        <p>Young Jeezy is an American rap artist best known for his solo album ‘Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101.’ A
            highly
            accomplished rapper today, he had been through several difficult challenges in his early life. Despite his
            sad and
            troubled childhood, which he once described as "empty", Jeezy was determined to put an end to his dark life,
            which often
            led him to jail. With his talent of shooting verses, and his ability to play with words, he made it to the
            limelight
            with the help of his rapping skills. However, his gangster past and history of drug abuse became obstacles
            in his
            career, as Atlanta radio stations were hesitant to play his songs. Nonetheless, he persevered and was soon
            able to find
            his niche. Jeezy was unconcerned about mainstream response to his music, considering the poor people on the
            streets to
            be his true audience. He consistently refused to become commercial or to cross over to other genres. With
            his strong
            determination, he made a position in the rap world in his own way, as his hit albums tell his success
            story—most of his
            singles and albums have found positions in the top charts. His successful works have made him one of his
            genre's most
            prominent rap artists. He has earned several platinum and gold certifications, several Grammy Award
            nominations, a line
            of Top Ten albums, and a number of Top Ten singles.
